# Markov01

Early 20th century linguistics conceived the language learning ability to be an application of general intelligence, whereby infants learn to speak by picking up on statistical regularities in speech. The markov model was widely discussed by the Behaviourist school as it is a simple model that can capture such statistical dependencies.

This is an example of a Markov model trained on part of Henrik Ibsen's - Norway's national poet - collected works.
